# `/deployments`

IaaS, PaaS, system and container orchestration deployment configurations and templates (docker-compose, kubernetes/helm, mesos, terraform, bosh).

Kube is used for multiples of docker containers to try and organize, without that it's not necessary
Still can test kube usage tho with Minikube. Since it takes the same docker image, it builds it fine
